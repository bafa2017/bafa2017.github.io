# Welcome to BAFA 2017
Neuroscience relies more and more on computational methods such as automated measuring tools for rodent behavior. Our goal is to stimulate the collaboration between neuroscientists and computer scientists for the development and improvement of such tools. Specifically, we aim at bringing the two fields closer together by increasing the understanding of each other's challenges and requirements. Streamlining the efforts into a common direction will increase the validity and acceptance of the developed tools. Eventually, automated measuring tools form a part of a refined, standardized methodology for animal behavior research that improves the reproducibility of the results and the value for translating them to the human.
