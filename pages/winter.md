## Brief introduction

Prof. York Winter is interested in how behaviour adapts animals to pursue their goals under the complex conditions of natural environments. This knowledge of animal behaviour is used to perform diagnostic tests in mouse and rat models of neurological and psychiatric diseases to promote translational research for medical purposes. The [Berlin Mouse Clinic for Neurology and Psychiatry](http://www.berlinmouseclinic.org), a modern behaviour diagnostic facility, is operated by him and his team within the NeuroCure Center of Excellence.

A long standing interest is the development of computer-based automation technology for the study of behaviour. His dedicated engineering lab at Humboldt University develops novel behaviour detection and experimentation technologies. Moreover, Prof. Winter is the founder of the start-up companies [PhenoSys](http://www.phenosys.com) and [LabMaker](http://www.labmaker.org) which develop these technologies further and help spreading them by being able to reach out not only to scientists but also to customers with their special demands.
