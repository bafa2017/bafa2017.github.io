Prof. Louk Vanderschuren obtained a MSc degree in Medical Biology (1990) and a PhD degree (1994) at Utrecht University. As a post-doctoral fellow, he studied the neurobiology of drug addiction at the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Cambridge. In 2010 he was appointed professor of [Behavioural Neuroscience](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-veterinary-medicine/about-the-faculty/departments/animals-in-science-and-society) at Utrecht University. His research deals with the neurobiology of social behavior, impulsive behavior, decision making and substance addiction. Research topics include the brain mechanisms underlying loss of control over substance intake in the development of addiction, the neurobehavioral commonalities and differences between substance and food addiction, and the relationship between cognitive impairments and addictive behavior. He investigates how delays, uncertainty and the expectancy of negative consequences modulate food choice, using sophisticated rodent models of decision making and impulse control.
