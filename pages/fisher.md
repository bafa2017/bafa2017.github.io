Since then, Bob has been an academic in the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) at University of Edinburgh. His research covers topics in high level and 3D computer vision, focussing on reconstructing geometric models from existing examples, which contributed to a spin-off company, Dimensional Imaging. More recently, he has also been researching video sequence understanding, in particular attempting to understand observed animal behaviour. The research has led to 13 authored or edited books and about 250 peer-reviewed scientific articles. He has developed several online computer vision resources, with over 1 million hits. Most recently, he has been the coordinator of an EC STREP project acquiring and analysing video data of 1.4 billion fish from over about 20 camera-years of undersea video of tropical coral reefs.
