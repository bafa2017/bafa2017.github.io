One of our main goals is to connect researchers from very different fields. The BAFA workshop is therefore not only a workshop but also a networking opportunity. The small size gives us the opportunity to get to know everyone. In the morning of the first workshop day, every participant will briefly introduce her/himself in about 5 minutes with max. 3 presentation slides.

We would like to hear a few words about your biography, what you are working on at the moment, and what challenges you face in your research that brought you to this workshop. The preparation of your introduction does not need to cost much time. Keep it simple!
